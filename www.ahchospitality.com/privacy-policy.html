A "cookie" is a small text file containing alphanumeric characters that is stored on your computer and uniquely identifies your browser. You consent to our cookies if you continue to use our Site. If you do not wish to allow cookies, please disable cookies by changing your browser settings before continuing to use this website. Please be aware that some of the Site’s functions or features may not work properly without cookies. The cookies we use are:</p><ul><li><strong>_ga</strong> - Google Analytics. used to distinguish unique users by assigning a randomly generated number as a client identifier.

When your browser downloads any graphic content in the e-mail, we will also place a cookie on your computer that will tell us if you come to our website at a later date.</p><p>In addition to our own cookies, we collaborate with various third-party service providers who also use cookies to help us optimize our website and understand more about the visitors to our website. For example, we use Google Analytics to provide us with demographic information about our visitors and to help us analyze how people use our website. Our third-party service providers include <a
href="https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/whitepapers/cookies/cookies_privacy.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adobe Analytics</a>, <a
href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Analytics</a>, and <a
href="https://www.facebook.com/policy/cookies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook Pixel</a>, and <a
href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/policies/#cookie-policy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Campaign Monitor</a>. To learn more about how these providers use cookies, please click the links above or visit their respective websites to view their privacy policies.</p><h3>Personal Information That You Provide in Relation to Requests for Information or Submitting Inquiries</h3><p><em><strong>What information is collected?</strong></em> When you request to receive our newsletter or submit information regarding an event inquiry, you will need to provide personal information, which may include your name, physical address, email address, phone number, and specific details about an event you would like to host. You do not have to provide additional information that is not explicitly requested; however, additional information may help you get more from our services. It is your choice whether to include sensitive information in your requests or submissions and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not post or add personal data to your requests or submissions that you would not want to be publicly available.</p><p><em><strong>How is this information collected?</strong></em> Personal information you provide is collected when you voluntarily provide the information. You therefore consent to the collection and processing of that data for the purposes set forth below.</p><p><em><strong>How is this information used and shared?</strong></em> When you voluntarily provide information, you consent to its collection, and we process such information to fulfill your requests and respond to your event inquiries. We allow our business partners to see information that you have provided to facilitate connections between users of this Site and our business partners. This information is only shared if you choose to include such information as part of your request or submission on our Site.</p><h3>Personal Information Related to Interaction with Our Site and Services</h3><p><em><strong>What information is collected?</strong></em> Personal information is created and collected when you provide it, ask questions, share information, or opt-in to Site features, and to help our partners improve their online offerings. Additionally, we log usage data when you visit or otherwise use our Site, such as when you view or click on content or ads, perform a search, or share information from other users.</p><p><em><strong>How is this information collected?</strong></em> This information is collected when you give it to us and as you interact with our Site and services. When you use our Site, opt-in to certain features, or use communication services in connection with our Site, you are creating personal data that we collect. We also collect information related to the general use of our Site using cookies, device information, and IP addresses to identify and log your use. The cookie and mobile device policies are discussed further below.</p><p><em><strong>How is this information used and shared?</strong></em> This information is used and shared to customize your experience with our Site and to communicate with you about events, products, and services that may interest you. Specifically, we may use the information we have about you to provide and personalize some of the Site’s features or services (such as ads) including with the help of automated systems and inferences we make, so the Site can be more relevant and useful to you and others. However, we do not use automated decision-making without human intervention, including profiling, in a way that would significantly affect you. Additionally, if you opt-in, we may use your personal information collected through the Site to provide you information about products, services, and events that we believe you may be interested in. You will always be given the opportunity to unsubscribe or opt out of receiving further communications or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions in the email communication.</p><h3>Personal Information Related to Browser and Analytics Data</h3><p><em><strong>What information is collected?</strong></em> Like many other websites, and regardless of which section of the Site you are visiting, we may record information that your browser routinely shares, and we may automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the Site ("Aggregate Information"). This information may include, for example, the URL that you have just come from (whether this URL is on our Site or not), the URL you go to next (whether this URL is on our Site or not), your computer’s browser information, mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity, text that is typed, and your IP address. We may also collect information such as your number of visits to the pages of the Site. If you have signed up to receive any of our e-mail communications, we use similar technology to count how many recipients have opened the message and clicked on one of its links.</p><p><em><strong>How is this information collected?</strong></em> This information is collected as a result of your browser sharing the information with us through the use of web beacons and cookies. Web beacons (also known as an action tags, clear gifs or pixel tags) are pixel images embedded in a website page used to transparently collect information. As mentioned above, a "cookie" is a small text file containing alphanumeric characters that is stored on your computer and uniquely identifies your browser. If you are simply browsing on this Site, the cookies that we use last only about as long as your session on this Site. We may allow business partners who provide services to this Site to place cookies on your computer that assist us in analyzing usage data. For example, we use Google Analytics to provide us with demographic information about our visitors and to help us analyze how people use our website, as further described below. We do not allow these business partners to collect your personal information from this Site except as may be necessary for the services that they provide.</p><p><em><strong>How is this information used and shared?</strong></em> This information is used to keep track of users and their preferences and to provide analysis about the visitors to our Site. Specifically, cookies are used to keep track of users and the services they have collected. Web beacons (or similar technology) help us track the effectiveness of our communications. For example, we may use a web beacon to count the number of visits to the pages of this Site.</p><p>In addition to the cookies utilized on this Site by us, AHC may allow trusted third parties, such as Stevens Advertising, to place advertisements for our products and services on sites and applications operated by others. These third parties may use cookies and web beacons to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to determine the display of content and advertising to you based on your interests both on our Site and other sites and applications that you may visit. To support this interest-based advertising solution, we and the companies we have contracted with may use anonymous information about your visits to our and other websites and applications. The information collected and used by this process is always anonymous and does not enable any third party to identify you individually. You can learn more about interest-based advertising and opt out of such advertising from certain companies at <a
href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aboutads.info</a>.</p><p><em><strong>Statistical analyses of the information:</strong></em> We use Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics to help us gather statistical information about the visitors to our Site and how they use the Site on an anonymous, aggregate basis. But, we will not associate this data with personally identifiable data unless required to do so to cooperate with law enforcement activity or other governmental request or to comply with law. We may use this information to gain a better understanding of the users of our Site, to improve our Site, and to improve our services and product offerings. Depending on the type of browser and device that you use, you may have the ability to control the type of information that Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics use. To understand how Google Analytics collects and processes data, please visit <a
href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>. To understand how Adobe Analytics collects and processes data, please visit <a
href="https://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html</a>. We reserve the right to license or sell Aggregate Information about the visitors to our Site, but this information will not contain your personal information or otherwise be individually identifiable.</p><p><em><strong>Remarketing:</strong></em> In addition to using cookies and related technologies as described above, we also permit certain third party companies such as Google, Facebook, and Adobe to help us tailor advertising that we think may be of interest to you on third party websites. Such third-party vendors use cookies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits to our Site. Any data collected will be used in accordance with this Privacy Notice as well as the third party companies’ privacy policies (including Google, Facebook, and Adobe). You can opt-out of remarketing by Google, Facebook, and Adobe by visiting the links below:</p><ul><li>Google: <a

The mobile Site and applications may include a feature that uses geographic location information.</p><p><em><strong>How is this information collected?</strong></em> This information is provided by your mobile device.</p><p><em><strong>How is this information used and shared?</strong></em> We do not collect or store your geographic information except to temporarily provide this Site. Your geographic information may be used to identify services in your vicinity in which you may be interested.</p><h3>Other Ways We May Share Your Personal Information</h3><p><em><strong>Information shared with our business partners and processors:</strong></em> We may use business partners to help us design and operate the Site, provide services to support the Site, process your information, and provide promotional and marketing activities on our behalf. For example, we may partner with restaurants, event centers, and other entities to obtain information that you have requested or hire a company to run certain website applications, help us analyze our data, or send information on our behalf about products, services and events in which you may be interested. Unless otherwise indicated at the time we collect your information, if we allow our business partners to access the personal information we collect, we will have contractual provisions or other appropriate protections in place to ensure such access is for limited purposes and in compliance with this Privacy Notice. A list of our current business partners that have access to certain personal information we collect is available upon request.</p><p><em><strong>Business operations, law enforcement and legal actions:</strong></em> We may release your information without prior notice when we believe it is appropriate to prevent fraud; to comply with law or to cooperate with law enforcement activity or other governmental request; to respond to subpoenas, court orders or administrative agency requests for information; to enforce our policies; to protect the rights, property and safety of our business and of others; or when required or otherwise permitted by law. For example, we may share information with law enforcement to reduce the risk of fraud or if someone uses or attempts to use our site for illegal reasons. If there is a sale or merger of our organization, we may also transfer the information we have collected in connection with such sale or merger.</p><h2>CROSS BORDER TRANSFERS OF INFORMATION</h2><p>Any information you provide to us through the use of the Site may be stored, processed, transferred among, and accessed from the United States and other countries which may not guarantee the same level of protection of personal information as the one in which you reside. However, we will handle your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice regardless of where your personal information is kept. Regarding transfers from the European Economic Area ("EEA") to the United States, we rely on the derogations for transfers which are necessary to perform the transaction with you. Where required by law, you may request a copy of the suitable mechanisms we have in place by contacting us as detailed below. If you reside in other non-US jurisdictions outside the EEA, your use of the Site or provision of any personal information constitutes your consent for the transfer of such data to the United States for the purposes identified above. If you have questions about cross-border transfers, please contact us as detailed below.</p><h2>DATA RETENTION</h2><p>We typically retain your personal information related to marketing activities for as long as you accept marketing communications from us, and we will securely delete such data in accordance with, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon request. For personal information that we collect and process for other purposes, we typically retain such personal information for no longer than for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice and as otherwise specified in applicable record retention policies and procedures. We may retain your personal information even after you have unsubscribed from our communications if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce our terms and conditions. We will retain de-personalized information after we have otherwise deleted your personal information.</p><h2>CONSEQUENCES OF NOT PROVIDING PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2><p>You are not required to provide all personal information identified in this Notice to use our Site or to interact with us offline, but certain functionality will not be available if you do not provide personal information. For example, if you do not provide personal information, we may not be able to respond to your request, perform a transaction with you, or provide you with marketing that we believe you would find valuable.</p><h2>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2><p>We maintain technical and organizational measures to protect the integrity of this Site and the personal information we collect from you from loss, misuse, alteration or unintentional destruction. However, we cannot provide absolute assurances against, and will not be liable for, any breaches of data security or confidentiality due to system failures or unauthorized access by third parties, or other causes beyond our reasonable control. You also have an important role in in protecting your information.</p><h2>VERIFYING, CHANGING, AND DELETING YOUR INFORMATION</h2><p>If the information you provided us is incorrect or if you have an issue with your information that we have collected, you can contact us as detailed below and ask us to change, update or fix your information in certain cases. You can also request that we erase or delete all or some of your personal information or otherwise object to, limit, or restrict the use of such information (if we have no legal right or legitimate business interest in retaining such information).</p><h2>CHILDREN</h2><p>Our Site is not directed at children under the age of 13 and we will not knowingly collect information about children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit your personal information.
